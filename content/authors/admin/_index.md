I am a PhD student in College of Intelligence and Computing in Tianjin University, supervised by Prof. [Longbiao Wang](http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/wanglongbiao/wang.html) and Prof. [Jianwu Dang](http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~jdang/index-e.htm). My research topic is Speech Separation Based on Deep Learning in Open Complex Environment.

Prior to that, I received my Masterâ€™s Degree from Tianjin University under the supervision of Prof. [Di Jin](http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/jindi/index.htm) and Prof. [Liang Yang](https://yangliang.github.io/) in 2017.
